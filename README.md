House Price Prediction Analysis
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the House Price Prediction project! This project aims to uncover the factors influencing house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, the methods used, key findings, and how you can run the analysis yourself.

Project Overview
This project dives deep into a real estate dataset to explore what factors most significantly affect house prices. Through this analysis, I aimed to not only predict house prices more accurately but also understand the underlying dynamics of the real estate market.

Methods
The analysis was carried out in several stages:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations to understand the data better.

Predictive Modeling:
Linear Regression: Served as a baseline for understanding linear impacts on house prices.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Used to model non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.

Key Insights
Proximity to MRT Stations: Strong negative correlation with house prices. Closer properties command higher prices.
Number of Convenience Stores: Positive correlation observed; more stores, higher prices.
Age of Property: Newer properties tend to have higher prices.

Visualizations
The repository includes various charts and graphs that illustrate the relationships between the features and house prices. These visualizations aid in making the data more accessible and understandable.


Feedback and Contributions
Your feedback and contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the analysis or find any issues, please feel free to create an issue or pull request.

Thank you for visiting my project, and I hope you find the insights interesting and useful!
